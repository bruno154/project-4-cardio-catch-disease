# Bussines Context

Our challenge is to help the **Cadio Catch Diseases** a company that specializes in detecting heart diseases in the early stages. 

Its bussiness model is 'service' it means that company offers an early heart diseases diagnostic for a price.

Importants Details:

- Actually the precision of the diagnostic is between 55% anmd 65%.
- For each 5% of acuracy over 50% the price is R$ 500,00

**Main Goal:**

Create a tool that increases diagnostic accuracy and that this accuracy is stable for all diagnostics.

**Secundary Goals:**

Answer the CEO questions,

1. What is the Accuracy and Precision of the tool?
2. How much profit will Cardio Catch Diseases have with the new tool?
3. How Reliable is the result given by the new tool?
