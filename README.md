# Bussines Context

Our challenge is to help the **Cadio Catch Diseases** a company that specializes in detecting heart diseases in the early stages. 

Its bussiness model is 'service' it means that company offers an early heart diseases diagnostic for a price.

Importants Details:

- Actually the precision of the diagnostic is between 55% anmd 65%.
- For each 5% of acuracy over 50% the price is R$ 500,00

**Main Goal:**

Create a tool that increases diagnostic accuracy and that this accuracy is stable for all diagnostics.

**Secundary Goals:**
